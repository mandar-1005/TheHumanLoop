# Product Vision – FedRAMP Training Creator (from Nancy meeting)

## The exact idea

A **tool for companies** (e.g. MARi) **to create** FedRAMP compliance trainings that their employees then take. Not a generic study app (NotebookLM-like); the system **generates** role-specific training modules from FedRAMP security documentation.

---

## Why this scope

- **Narrow:** Focus on FedRAMP + SSP + a few roles.
- **Specific:** Clear inputs (SSP + roles) and outputs (training module with study guide + assessment).
- **Novel:** Role-based assessment design (Bloom’s taxonomy: remembering → applying → creating), not just one-size-fits-all quizzes.

---

## FedRAMP & SSP (context)

- **FedRAMP** = government security certification for cloud services.
- **SSP (System Security Plan)** = document that defines how an organization implements FedRAMP security practices. Each org (e.g. MARi) has its own SSP.
- **Input:** We use an SSP (likely **synthetic/fake**, generated by Gemini, since real SSPs are confidential) + information about the organization’s roles.

---

## MARi’s four roles (example)

1. **Developers**
2. **Security leads**
3. **Developer team leads**
4. *(Fourth role TBD – “something else”)*

Role drives **what** is taught and **how** it’s assessed (see below).

---

## Inputs → Outputs

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **SSP** | System Security Plan (synthetic for demo; real ones confidential) |
| **Role definitions** | The 4 (or N) roles: name, level, responsibilities |

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Training module** | One coherent package per role (or one module with role-specific paths) |
| **Content summary / study guide** | Digest of relevant FedRAMP/SSP content for that role |
| **Assessment** | Role-appropriate format; see below |

---

## Role-based assessment (Bloom’s taxonomy)

Assessment **format and cognitive level** depend on the role:

| Role / level | Cognitive level | Example assessment format |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Developers** | Remembering / understanding | **Multiple choice** – “know how to follow FedRAMP” |
| **Higher level (e.g. dev lead)** | Applying / creating | **Case study** – scenario-based; **AI-graded** |
| (Other roles) | Varies | **Short response**, **flashcards**, **MC**, **case studies** as appropriate |

So: **remembering** → MC/flashcards; **applying** → short response / scenarios; **creating** → case studies, AI grading. This is the “change format by role” idea from Nancy.

---

## Assessment formats in scope

- Multiple choice
- Short response
- Case studies (AI-graded)
- Flashcards (for recall)

Format chosen per role to match Bloom’s level and learning goals.

---

## Primary user

- **Company** (e.g. MARi) creating FedRAMP training – they provide SSP + roles and get back a **training module** (study guide + assessment).
- **Employees** are the **consumers** of that training (take the assessment, use the study guide); they may do this inside our tool or via exported content.

---

## Summary table

| Before (generic) | After (Nancy meeting) |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Study tool for employees | **Tool for companies to create** FedRAMP trainings |
| One-size-fits-all quizzes | **Role-based** training + **role-based assessment format** |
| Generic “learning platform” | **SSP in → training module out** (study guide + assessment) |
| NotebookLM-like | **FedRAMP training creator** with Bloom’s-driven assessment design |

---

## Alignment with existing docs

- **Auth / roles:** Can stay “MARi employees” for the **creators** (e.g. L&D, compliance) and/or **learners** (developers, security leads, etc.); clarify in UX who is “creating” vs “taking” training.
- **Content:** “Quizzes” and “descriptive answers” still apply; add **study guide**, **MC**, **short response**, **case studies**, **flashcards**, and **AI grading** where relevant.
- **Agents:** Used to create role-specific training from FedRAMP/SSP docs and to grade case studies.

All product and roadmap docs should treat this as: **company-facing FedRAMP training creator**, **SSP + roles in**, **training module (study guide + role-based assessment) out**, with **Bloom’s-driven assessment by role**.
